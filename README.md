# About me
Kia Ora! I'm a software student from NZ, studying software engineering. 

I've got a website here: [anothercat.me](https://anothercat.me)

## Projects

My main projects so far have been based around discord, for example [message manager](https://github.com/message-manager-discord)

I've also made some smaller level bots for custom purposes, [TicketThreadBot](https://github.com/PlaygunTim/TicketThreadBot), and [interactions-proxy](https://github.com/AnotherCat/interactions-proxy) (ongoing).

I've dabbled in game design as a high school project https://github.com/AnotherCat/dtc-level-2-game
